            Hey, It is a common perception that at a later age it is hard to learn new things and switch your career 
            but to be honest I personally know many folks who learned data analytics, data science at 40+ age and made 
            this transition. One other person I know was a physical therapist till age 51 and now he is a data 
            analyst working in a healthcare company. Watch this video to know about few such 
            stories: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkvInnpuic8
            In short, it is 100% possible, if you have an eagerness to learn and a commitment 
            towards making this career switch. 
            Also one great thing about data analyst career is it requires very less coding so it will not 
            be very difficult for you! So yes, you can learn data analysis at your age.
